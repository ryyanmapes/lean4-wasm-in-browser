# The Natural Numbers Game in the browser

This site ships two versions of The Natural Numbers Game plus a Visual Lean
capabilities demo:

- **Vanilla NNG4** — the original tactic-based Lean4Game experience.
- **Visual Lean** — the full NNG4 curriculum with direct, visual proof
  manipulation.

Both games use the same persistent, single-threaded Lean WebAssembly worker.
Proof checking runs locally in the browser; there is no hosted Lean server.
The Lean environment is loaded once and reused while the player moves between
levels in any order. Algorithm World is intentionally excluded.

## Local development

Generated release assets are expected at:

```text
public/lean4game/                  Lean4Game client and game data
public/visual-lean/runtime/        lean.js and lean.wasm
public/visual-lean/modules/        reduced Lean module closure
public/lean-worker-persistent.worker.js
```

Start the site with `npm install` and `npm run dev`, then open
`http://localhost:5173`.

To rebuild and copy the Lean4Game client and metadata from the sibling
`Lean4Game` checkout, run `npm run sync-lean4game-client`. The sync packages
NNG4 and the Visual Capabilities Demo while excluding Algorithm World and the
unreferenced duplicate public font tree.

## Production release

`.github/workflows/docker-release.yml` builds the single canonical release. It:

1. builds the no-pthread Lean WASM runtime and reduced module closure;
2. assembles and publishes the nginx image;
3. validates all 66 Visual NNG levels and classic export;
4. extracts that exact validated image and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

The runtime does not use `SharedArrayBuffer`, so static hosting does not need
COOP/COEP response headers.

The workflow publishes:

```text
ghcr.io/ryyanmapes/lean4-wasm-in-browser:latest
ghcr.io/ryyanmapes/lean4-wasm-in-browser:sha-<commit>
```

Run the container with:

```bash
docker run --detach \
  --name natural-numbers-game \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --publish 8080:80 \
  ghcr.io/ryyanmapes/lean4-wasm-in-browser:latest
```

## GitHub Pages and custom domain

GitHub Pages deploys the validated static tree at the repository's Pages site.
The repository Pages setting uses this custom domain:

```text
leangame.autumnofautumn.com
```

The DNS record for that subdomain must be a `CNAME` pointing directly to:

```text
ryyanmapes.github.io
```

Do not include the repository name in the CNAME target. The application uses
root-relative asset URLs because the custom domain serves this project at `/`.

## Source layout

```text
src/                              small release launcher
public/lean4game/                 generated Lean4Game application
public/visual-lean/               generated WASM runtime and module bundle
